        <h2> Problem Statement: </h2>
        <p> Parking around the University of South Carolina and within the city of Columbia, SC is scarce and incredibly hard to find. Many times students and staff alike will be late to their classes or events happening around campus because they were busy finding parking for an incredibly long time. Our solution should be simple to use and provide users with information relating to where available parking is on or around campus. </p>
